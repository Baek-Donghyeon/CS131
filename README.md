# V2V-PoseNet-pytorch-ITOP
This is a pytorch implementation of V2V-PoseNet([V2V-PoseNet: Voxel-to-Voxel Prediction Network for Accurate 3D Hand and Human Pose Estimation from a Single Depth Map](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.07399)) for ITOP dataset, which is largely based on the author's [torch7 implementation](https://github.com/mks0601/V2V-PoseNet_RELEASE) and pytorch reimplementation of V2V-PoseNet for MSRA hand dataset(https://github.com/dragonbook/V2V-PoseNet-pytorch).

For more information, visit those webpages and download ITOP dataset(https://zenodo.org/record/3932973) and precalculated reference points(https://github.com/mks0601/V2V-PoseNet_RELEASE) in datasets folder.

* Additional visualization demo(draw_skeleton) in experiment folder produces a short video clip with estimated skeleton implemented.
